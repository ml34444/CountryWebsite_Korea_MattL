                    Some well known attractions across social media would be the Night Market located in Seoul, Korea's capital city.
                    Seoul's Night Market contains an exceptional variety of goods and foods for both regular citizens and tourists.
                    Along with that, the neon signs and decorations create a vibrant atmosphere during this time of night.
                    Seemlessly, this bright environment almost seems like it never sleeps at all.
