                    In 1945, during the Cold War, Korea had split into two parts. Its Northern part followed Communist ideas while South Korea follows democracy.
                    Later on, North Koreans would later attempt to escape North Korea due to its strict rules and seek refuge in South Korea with varying success.

                    This process is very risky however, since escapees that were caught wouldn't have been sentenced to just death but they were tortured and labeled as traitor.
                    Despite this, people still attempt rescue operations and secret infiltrations into its Northern part to try to rescue people attempting to escape this sovereignty.
