                    A very small but overlooked aspect in Korean culture is its honorifics. Something as small as bowing or
                    changing a verbal ending based off of the person's age and status. Bowing in Korean culture can be seen 
                    as a sign of respect towards especially elders. A bow in Korean culture can be used as a traditional
                    greeting or a sign of respect towards elders. Before a martial arts fight would begin, both fighters
                    would bow towards each other as a sign of respect, which had first rooted from Japanese Samurai.

                    The verbal ending when referring to someone's name depends both on the speaker and
                    recipient's gender. Males would refer to older women as "Noona" and older men as
                    "Oppa". Females however would refer to older women as "Unnie" and refer to older
                    men as "Hyung". Calling someone by the proper honorific would signify a deep sense
                    of respect towards them, as well conveys that you are aware of their age and status.
